# Element Customization Tool

This repository contains two web applications, showcasing a view of a 3D model in browsers.

The webapps are hosted via GitHub pages:
1) A [C# Unity web app](https://michaeliusachapelo.github.io/ElementCustomizationTool/Unity.html), created in one hour.
2) A [TypeScript + React Three Fiber](https://michaeliusachapelo.github.io/ElementCustomizationTool/index.html) page, created in five hours.

Make sure WebGL is allowed in your browser. Both webapps feature basic camera controls and a palette to pick material colour.

Source code for both projects are located in the **main branch**, while the **page branch** contains the files hosted on GitHub pages.
